I am a third-year master’s student in the School of Ocean Sciences at China University of Geosciences (Beijing). During my graduate studies, I spent two years as a visiting student in the Faculty of Electronic and infomation Engineering at Xi’an Jiaotong University for a joint cultivation training plan. My research interests include satellite remote sensing, coastal environment parameters, physical oceanography, and machine learning. And My master’s thesis topic is ‘Microwave Brightness Temperature Decomposition of Mixed Pixels and Environment Parameters Retrieval in Coastal Areas’, and it is now almost complete.

I am deeply grateful to [Prof. Peilin Song](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/0020220124/home) at the Faculty of Electronic and Information Engineering of Xi’an Jiaotong University, for his guidance, and I would also like to thank [Prof. Hongchen Jiang](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/jianghongchen/zh_CN/index.htm) at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) for his selfless support in my academic endeavors.
