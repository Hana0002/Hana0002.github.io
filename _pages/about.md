I am a third-year master’s student in the School of Ocean Sciences at China University of Geosciences (Beijing). During my graduate studies, I spent two years as a visiting student in the Faculty of Electronic and infomation Engineering at Xi’an Jiaotong University for a joint cultivation training plan. My research interests include satellite remote sensing, coastal environment parameters, physical oceanography, and machine learning. And My master’s thesis topic is ‘Microwave Brightness Temperature Decomposition of Mixed Pixels and Environment Parameters Retrieval in Coastal Areas’, and it is now almost complete.

I am deeply grateful to [Prof. Peilin Song](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/0020220124/home) at the Faculty of Electronic and Information Engineering of Xi’an Jiaotong University, for his guidance, and I would also like to thank [Prof. Hongchen Jiang](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/jianghongchen/zh_CN/index.htm) at China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) for his selfless support in my academic endeavors.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. 

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
